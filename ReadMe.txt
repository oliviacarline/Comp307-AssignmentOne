ReadMe:


If possible, please compile and create the executables (Sorry, eclipse has stopped working on laptop) Each file requires parameters as shown below. And data files should be should be outside of the src file. 


With KNN:
iris-training.txt and iris-test.txt should be in the same directory as the jar file and file path to the two files (order should be iris-training.txt and iris-text.txt) should be passed in as arguments when run on command line.

With NearestNeighbours:
Assuming the file structure remains unchanged, if you donâ€™t give any arguments, the program should run through the ten test data files created. If you do give arguments, first should be 
hepatitis-training.dat and second should be hepatitis-test.dat

With Perception:
Takes one parameter, image.data which if you are compiling yourself, once again should be outside of the src file.

Again, I am sorry that the jar files ar malfunctioning (on my end)
